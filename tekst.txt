So now, we're going to combine everything in the previous lectures and we're going to actually make our first program. 
So before we make this program, we need to talk a little bit about documentation. 
We talked about mnemonic variables as a friendly thing for humans. 
Another thing that's a friendly thing in programs for humans, and you will tend to realize that the human that you're 
being friendly to when you're writing code and you're doing it well, is yourself. 
So good variable names are going to help you a lot. They might help your teaching assistant but they're also going to help you. 
Comments. Comments are a way for us to add text that's ignored by Python to our programs. 
So it's a great way to give a little idea what's going on in code, maybe
